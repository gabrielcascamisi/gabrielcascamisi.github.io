  <h1>Mycelium Snowman: Growth & Fabrication Process</h1>
  <p>
    This project explored the growth and shaping of a mycelium-based structure into a snowman mold as a demonstration of sustainable, biologically derived materials. The process began by 
preparing a nutrient dense substrate, which was sterilized to minimize contamination and ensure controlled fungal growth. Once cooled, the substrate was inoculated with mycelium and mixed 
thoroughly to promote uniform colonization.

The inoculated substrate was then packed into a custom mold in the shape of a snowman. During the growth phase, the mold was held in a dark space with a controlled temperature 
and humid conditions to support mycelial expansion. Over time, the mycelium grew throughout the substrate, binding the substrate into a cohesive, self-supporting composite.

After colonization, the molded components were removed and allowed to dry, halting further biological activity and increasing structural stability.

This project demonstrated how mycelium growth can be guided through mold design and environmental control to produce lightweight, biodegradable forms with minimal energy input.

  <h2>Mycelium Mousepad: Growth & Fabrication Process</h2>
  <p>
    This project focused on the fabrication of a functional mousepad using mycelium-based composite materials. The goal was to use excess inoculated substrate that did not fit in the snowman 
mold and explore the feasibility of producing a flat, durable, and biodegradable mousepad through controlled biological growth.

The nutrient dense substrate was prepared and sterilized to reduce contamination and promote consistent mycelial colonization. The substrate was then inoculated with mycelium and mixed to 
ensure uniform growth throughout the material. Then the substrate was placed into a plastic bag with small slits to ensure airflow and ideal humidity conditions. The bag was then compressed 
to form a flat smooth configuration to achieve uniform thickness suitable for a mousepad.

During incubation, environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity were carefully maintained to encourage dense mycelial growth and effective binding of the substrate. As the mycelium 
colonized, it formed a cohesive composite with sufficient structural integrity for handling and use.

Once full colonization was achieved, the material was removed from the plastic bag and dried to terminate biological activity and improve mechanical stability. The resulting mousepad demonstrated 
a relatively smooth, continuous surface with adequate rigidity.

However, this experiment was conducted without the use of a mold. Subsequently, the end product did not yield a perfectly functional mousepad. The product did however highlight the potential of 
mycelium-based composites for sustainable alternatives to petroleum-based consumer products.

This project illustrates how growth parameters such as geometry can be fine tuned to produce functional, application-specific forms.

If this project were to be repeated, a breathable flat mold would be utilized to constrain the substrate between two planar surfaces, ensuring uniform thickness, improved mycelial colonization, 
and a consistently flat surface suitable for reliable mouse interaction.
