  <h1>Mycelium Snowman: Growth & Fabrication Process</h1>
  <p>
    This project explored the growth and shaping of a mycelium-based structure into a snowman mold as a demonstration of sustainable, biologically derived materials. The process began by 
preparing a nutrient dense substrate, which was sterilized to minimize contamination and ensure controlled fungal growth. Once cooled, the substrate was inoculated with mycelium and mixed 
thoroughly to promote uniform colonization.

The inoculated substrate was then packed into a custom mold in the shape of a snowman. During the growth phase, the mold was held in a dark space with a controlled temperature 
and humid conditions to support mycelial expansion. Over time, the mycelium grew throughout the substrate, binding the substrate into a cohesive, self-supporting composite.

After colonization, the molded components were removed and allowed to dry, halting further biological activity and increasing structural stability.

This project demonstrated how mycelium growth can be guided through mold design and environmental control to produce lightweight, biodegradable forms with minimal energy input.
